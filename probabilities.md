# Probabilities

## Rolling with advantage

Roll `2d20` and keep the highest value.

- Probability to achieve a value of 1: `1/20 * 1/20 = 0.0025`
- Probability to achieve a value of 2: `(1/20 * 1/20) + (1/20 + 2/20) = 0.0075`
- Probability to achieve a value of 3: `(1/20 * 1/20) + (1/20 * 1/20) + (1/20 * 3/20) = 0.0125`
